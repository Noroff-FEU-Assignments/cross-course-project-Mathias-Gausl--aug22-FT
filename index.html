    <h1>Hello world!</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my first website.</p>
    <h2>Web Security</h2>
    <p id="web-security-question">How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web security attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be greater than 250 words</p>
    <p id="web-security-answer">I would advise a potential client to use different security solutions to secure their website from attacks, this include a third-party program like Nodejs to sanitize HTML code.
         I would also recommend a CI/CD tool to help catch bugs and security weak points, and to make the coding prosses faster. User timeout is also a great way to make sure important information wonâ€™t be I the browser for too long.
          Eighter two step verification, like onetime codes sent too email or mobile or a third-party authorization tool like OneLogin is also a great way to keep user data safe. Its also important to choose a trusted, safe and secure hosting service, 
          different hosting services will have different security measures. You will also need https for a secure URL, and SSL for secure encryption especially if your website includes user data and/or transactions. After all the necessary security measures
           are in place you can check your website on a site called Pentest-tool or another security checker website to see if your site got any weak points that an attacker can use.</p>
