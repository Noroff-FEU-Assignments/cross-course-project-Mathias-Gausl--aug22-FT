*GameHub CA, Mathias Gauslå

*For this course assignment in css and html, we made our CA from design 1 into a working website.

*For this project I tried to make a website that is responsive and works well for all normal screen sizes, it also supports the most popular browsers. Like in the design CA it got one version for mobile and for desktop, I made the screen-width breakpoints to 600px, so all screens with a width under 600px view the site in mobile, and all over 600px see it I desktop.  I used one stylesheet for this project. The website is also checked for accessibility.


*Changes: 
Figma prototype: 
desktop: https://www.figma.com/file/BCOtfmkcZ0HyzyyFTzr66d/CA-25.09.22?node-id=3%3A4
mobile: https://www.figma.com/file/491dAR1Bb4QRZtwPaSi6uv/ca-25.09.22-finished?node-id=0%3A1

I made some small changes to the website compared to the prototype. The navigation is a little bit different and all nav elements are placed closer to each other. The contact element is also placed with the other nav elements so it’s easier to find, I believe this helps with user experience. I also grouped all products into two categories (products and used games) instead of grouping them into five different categories (ps5, pc, Xbox, used games, sales). The mobile navigation has almost no changes. The product page layout is the same for mobile but for desktop I expanded it to three columns instead of two. All products are now interactable instead of only three. I also expanded the checkout page and contact page with forms, so users can input payment information on the checkout page and send direct messages on the contact page.I also changed all the buttons and nav elements to have a hover effect so its easier to navigate with or whitout a computer mouse. 

*Supports major browsers
